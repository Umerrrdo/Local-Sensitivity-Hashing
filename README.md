# Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Implementation

This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive implementation of Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for approximate nearest neighbor search. LSH is a powerful technique for efficient similarity search in high-dimensional spaces, and this implementation aims to provide a fast and scalable solution.

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This implementation is designed to be user-friendly and easily understandable. The code is well-documented, and comments are provided to guide you through each step.

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`LSH_Implementation.ipynb`) in your preferred environment.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook.
3. Utilize the provided example data or replace it with your dataset for experimentation.

For a deeper understanding of LSH, refer to the following resource: [Locality-Sensitive Hashing - Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/locality-sensitive-hashing/)
